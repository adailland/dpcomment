Since nobody has done this yet, I decided to get things started:

Todo:

 push the relevant commits to rust-lang/llvm and rust-lang/compiler-rt

 cleanup .gitmodules

 Verify if there are any other commits from rust-lang/llvm which need backporting

 Investigate / fix debuginfo ("<optimized out>") failures

 Use correct emscripten version in docker image

Closes #37609.

Test results:

Everything is green 🎉

@TimNN you can probably work faster than going through @bors by selectively adding ALLOW_PR=1 to various entries in .travis.yml, that'll run the tests on the PR itself before we hit @bors.

I'd recommend doing that for a couple of the cross targets at least and then probably some of the other builders as well (such as emscripten)

My guess is that AppVeyor will be one of the most difficult pieces to update as part of this upgrade. Unfortunately we don't have any extra capacity there for running tests so it may be difficult to do so on the PR before bors :(

The debuginfo failures all occur because static muts are optimized out. (I verified that no optimisation flags were passed to rustc).

I'm unsure what the best fix would be here (something like the #[used] attribute from #39987 would probably work).

>>>rkruppe, Contributor

static muts getting optimized out sounds like an issue with the IR/debug info we generate. Perhaps one of the debug info-related changes was incomplete and we don't emit everything we need to emit for globals? (#39528 looks very related.) To clarify, does this:

static muts are optimized out

I vaguely remember about statics being optimized away the last summer already, when I wrote debuginfo tests for unions (one of the failing tests in this PR).

Maybe the LLVM optimizer become better and now sees that the optimization is still possible?

The missing std::thread business may be related to how we compile compilers. It may be that one of our compilers is too old or something like that. I know that MinGW C++ compilers, at least, do not have std::thread (at least if I'm remembering correctly). Historically we've "dealt" with this by just deleting code that uses std::thread, but it's clearly getting harder over time! This also isn't scalable into the future really.

Fascinating! Unfortunately I may not be of much help. Also thanks for the links, I should have looked around for them! Of the failures so far:

armhf - this is really suspicious. In theory if qemu-test-server panics in any way we'd see it in the logs (as it doesn't daemonize that much or anything), but I'm not seeing anything. The errors mean that the server is prematurely closing the connection, but I'm not sure how that's possible without otherwise printing error information! It may be a bug in LLVM or related to the assertion failures, but it may also require more debugging the qemu instance itself :(

emscripten - looks like you're on top of these (maybe fastcomp regressions? maybe llvm regression? unsure myself...)

android - yeah looks like an LLVM bug? Although I wouldn't rule out invalid codegen on our side just yet.

s390x-netbsd - Ok so this specifically failed to compiled LLVM for NetBSD. This is our script to compile NetBSD gcc and I don't see anything immediately wrong that should compile the wrong C++. I wonder if the gcc options accidentally disable std::thread? Or maybe it's disabled somewhere else on NetBSD by default? Not sure why that happened :(

Some other tips I'd have is:

You can run docker images locally via ./src/ci/docker/run.sh $image_name which can help with debugging (e.g. avoiding going through Travis). That should in theory use the precise same environment as Travis modulo kernel and hardware.

For suspected LLVM bugs the best way (although certainly not the fastest way) that I know to work with them is to (a) get it to reproduce with a manual rustc invocation then (b) get it to reproduce with an opt invocation by using rustc to generate LLVM IR then switching to LLVM's tools and then (c) minimizing that IR as much as possible. If it's small enough then reporting a bug on LLVM's issue tracker is usually good for getting the issue fixed in a timely fashion.

Some notes on the armhf-gnu image:

I (once) got the same LLVM assertion as on android, this went away when retrying the build. I'll try to get this to reliably reproduce.

The qemu connection errors happen non deterministically, as far as I can tell, example: run-pass ran successfully, incremental failed afterwards, after a retry all ofrun-pass failed.

Now I got a segfault... and no idea what actually segfaulted...

First of all a small progress update: Of the 25 Docker based builds, 16 build without problems, 2 required (small) fixes, 2 timed out on travis but succeeded locally and 5 are currently broken. I'll investigate the broken images over the next days when I have the time.

Some notes on the android failure:

The arm-android image causes an llvm assertion:

This happens while compiling the coretest crate:

While running llvm passes, full backtrace:

I will attempt to build llvm / rustc with debug info tomorrow to get some more information on what is going on.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

@TimNN FWIW timing out on travis may be fixed by re-running. If travis has a cold cache for both the docker image and LLVM it's likely to fail, but with sccache you'll likely cache LLVM the first time so the second build will have it cached (just a guess). If it passes locally though I'd be pretty confident that it'll pass on Travis.

Also thank you so much again for taking this on!

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I have (somewhat) minified the android assertion, compiling the generated llvm IR with llc triggers the same assertion. The assertion only triggers when compiling with optimizations. IR and the minified example: https://gist.github.com/52fcea6426c872869269114c47f96e1f

@TimNN: looks like the ExpandStructRegs pass is doing something wrong. It translates a bunch of insertvalues + a store volatile of their result into a bunch of store volatiles of undef. So it's losing the actual data, and only 0s will be stored.

That pass is originally from NaCl, and I'm not that familiar with its internals. So first thing that could help is to know if this is a new pattern of IR being generated? Is this a new test in 4.0, or is Rust in 4.0 generating something it didn't use to?

In particular, the relevant type here is %E = type { [32 x i64] }, that's what that pass is trying to legalize. Perhaps the pass can't handle arrays inside structs.

Ok, if it's the same IR as before, then either LLVM is optimizing it differently, or emscripten is compiling it differently.

And running emscripten on that gives me the same results as well. However, when I opt -O3 your unoptimized code, I don't get the same optimized code - so perhaps the optimization flags matter. How are you generating the optimized code?

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Running opt -O3 on the unoptimized ll from your gist results in the same output in both LLVM versions

However, when I opt -O3 your unoptimized code, I don't get the same optimized code

How are you generating the optimized code?

The optimized code is generated using opt -S -O1 vol.ll -o vol-opt.ll

>>>TimNN, Contributor

By the way -- I don't need to run opt again, just compiling the -opt.ll files with emcc (-O0) is enough to trigger the bad code. See https://gist.github.com/TimNN/76ca254f3ad4105dd83d39721a02e118 for the complete emcc command.

Alright, manually running the test on rust with llvm 3.9 does fail as well... Now to find out why this is not picked up during normal testing... / occurs in my update builds.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So the mystery why the test passes with rustc + llvm 4.0 is solved, consider the following table and that rust compiles tests with -O2:

Results of the test case with different LLVM version / optimization levels (the -O flag was given directly to rustc):

LLVM 3.9

fail

-O3

I'm unsure how this relates to your observation that the generated IR is the same for LLVM 3.9 / 4.0 however this at least explains why the test passes on rust pre 4.0.

I have uploaded some more IR at https://gist.github.com/86c800a71b4654912626ad6e13105d90:

Not (yet), there are still some other things which need to be fixed. Among them is one other emscripten failure (related to packed structs, I think), however I have not yet had the time to investigate that.

By the way, rust uses the 1.37.1 tag of emscripten IIRC, however I don't know which exact llvm version is used by rust itself.

>>>pftbest, Contributor

Rust is using llvm revision 282753. It is somewhere between 3.9 and 3.9.1 release.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So the second emscripten failure is actually due to #27060 I believe: rustc emits loads to unaligned pointers (to contents of a #[repr(packed)] struct) without marking them as unaligned. The test passed previously when compiled with -O2 (which is what the test runner uses) put not with -O0.

I've been investigating some of the failures some more:

I currently can't reproduce the powerpc failure (locally). I'll try travis again at some point.

The qemu-test-server segfaults, which causes the armhf-gnu failure. I don't know yet why or where.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

After lots of printf debugging (anyone know how to easily use gdb with qemu?) I've identified and (somewhat) minified the segfault.

As far as I can tell three things are required for the segfault to occur:

A function returning a u32

Which is immediately cast to a u64 and assigned to a variable

That variable is printed (which probably means a reference is taken and then dereferenced)

Edit: Nevermind that, the problem seems to be somewhere else.

To reproduce use this code as the qemu-test-client and send any four bytes. Sending any four bytes to the server should show @@EXIT@@: 11 in the output.

I'll try to reduce this a bit further and submit an upstream bug report.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Edit: Never mind this post, see the next post.

Further minified:

This crashes on -O0 as well.

The IR looks good to me, see this gist.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I apparently made some wrong assumptions in the previous two posts, the actual issue seems to be with the Display implementation of u64, at least that's where the segfault occurs in the following reduced test case: 0xFFFFFFFFu64.to_string();.

Which raises another question: The original qemu-test-server never calls that method (at least not directly), so where does it segfault?

Anyway, I got the following backtrace from a core dump (qemu has so far resisted all my attempts to directly debug it):

>>>TimNN, Contributor

The segfault only occurs if std is compiled with optimizations. configureing with --disable-optimize makes that segfault from the reduced test cases go away and the qemu-test-server seems to be stable so far. Lets see how the the actual tests go...

... so I just got a rather interesting failure of the qemu-test-server:

Running with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 produces this:

Don't ask me where the negative line numbers come from, some of the others seem to be incorrect as well.

Running with RUST_BACKTRACE=full causes the following output (and then hangs):

My guess would be a miscompile or a misoptimization, although historically LLVM upgrades have uncovered existing bugs in the compiler which were only exploited by the newer LLVM version, so this may very well also be a bug in our own codegen.

One thing I noticed while poking around at things is in the output of readelf on the generated binaries (grepped for udivsi3):

I know that there have been discussions of marking functions as hidden, so maybe the above tells someone something?

Edit: Note that in the libcompiler_builtins.rlib, the symbol is marked as GLOBAL HIDDEN in both cases.

Hm that seems unusual. We try to compile that symbol as a hidden symbol, but that's just a flag we pass to the compiler when compiling compiler-rt. I'm not sure how that would change here... Unless the symbol was dropped/moved in the compiler-rt upgrade?

>>>TimNN, Contributor

And things are getting interesting again: The interesting symbol is __aeabi_uidiv (which is, of course, an alias for __udivsi3...): Now checking the libcomiler_builtins.rlib files for that symbol gives the following results:

Well, that didn't work. On the other hand, I discovered that GDB was being annoying and the whole visibility thing was entirely the wrong direction:

In the disassembly of my test program, gdb showed bl 0xf6fddee8 <__udivsi3>

Checking info symbol __udivsi3 says the symbol came from libgcc_s.so.1

Checking info symbol 0xf6fddee8 says the symbol comes from my binary

So we are apparently miscompiling comiler-rt -- which does seem more reasonable than libgcc_s being broken.

We may just not be compiling with the right flags as well (or be targetting something completely different). I've never gotten a good handle on what appears to be a myriad of ARM targets...

That symbol in theory should be public yeah, although I've also never been able to decipher the output of nm so I'm not sure if that's the right visibility or not (have I mentioned that I've also never been able to keep the myriad of visibility/linkage settings straight in my head either?).

@TimNN does it print out where that undefined reference is coming from? It may be related to #40254 if you haven't picked that up yet maybe. Or it may also be somewhere else in libcompiler_builtins which is accidentally wanting to unwind when it shouldn't want to be.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

@alexcrichton: I have #40254 in my branch, the undefined references are in the main code, examples:

By the way, these are the failing tests:

I can also reproduce with a program that simply panic!()s in main:

Ok yeah that seems entirely unrelated to compiler-rt.

Can you check the IR generated for libcore? It may be helpful to take a look at the function definition for this symbol to see what we're telling LLVM. (hint: it shouldn't be internal)

Alright, so I think I know some of what is going on, however how that is different from LLVM 3.9, I don't know (yet):

As it turns out, libcompiler_builtins has references to core::panicking::panic! And if it is linked into the .so after libcore, the symbol gets hidden (I've only checked the nm, not yet a test compilation).

For the record, the following functions call core::panicking::panic (if I'm reading the output of readelf correctly):

cc @nagisa You fixed this (or something similar) in #40254, could you maybe take a look?

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So, apparently, the problem with the panic references is that compiler_builtins was compiled without optimizations. Whether this is ARM specific or caused by LLVM 4.0, I don't know yet, we'll see.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

Oh dear, that sounds bad! Note that with or without optimizations, the compiler builtins crate shouldn't reference any panic symbols...

>>>nagisa, Contributor

The panicking is introduced by overflowing_sh* which has implementation that looks like this:

That shift over there is a checked shift and does not get optimised in no-opt mode. wrapping_sh* are implemented in terms of this overflowing_sh*. These could be fixed with some intrinsics, maybe?

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I opened #40508 for the ARM / panic failure.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So some (mostly good, I guess) news: A (once again) optimized ARM build with the two commits mentioned previously reverted leads to almost all run-pass tests passing, with three (issue-28950.rs, run-pass/panic-runtime/abort.rs and run-pass/panic-runtime/abort-link-to-unwinding-crates.rs) hanging... somewhere. I'll investigate those as well as a "proper" fix for the reverted commits.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Investigation results (on a Raspberry Pi 2):

issue-28950.rs: segfault injemalloc::arena_run_split_remove -> std::sys::imp::stack_overflow::imp::signal_handler -> thread local cleanup / atexit -> jemalloc -> deadlock

abort.rs: Runs fine without RUST_BACKTRACE, with =1 it hangs somewhere during unwinding (although I don't think we set RUST_BACKTRACE by default when running tests?), potentially a dead lock as well

abort-link-to-unwinding-crates.rs: Same as abort.rs

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

@TimNN we're still running into jemalloc dealocks?!

:( :( :( :( :(

>>>TimNN, Contributor

@alexcrichton: Apparently :( Although it only happened after a segfault, so it's probably not that bad? Here is the backtrace, in case you are interested: https://gist.github.com/0b02e3fae217490cd004ea8a58b22f83

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Regarding the issue-28950.rs segfault / deadlock:

I can only assume that somehow jemalloc is miscompiled: The failures happens in the newly started thread, before any user code is run.

Now consider these three lines from the gdb stacktrace:

The relevant jemalloc code.

Notice how arena is 0x766011c0 in arena_run_alloc_large, but when it is passed to arena_run_alloc_large_helper, it is NULL (and then later dereferenced in a probably inlined function?).

I'm not sure if these symptoms are indicative of a stackoverflow or not, however the test seems to deliberately test something in that regard.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

Note that I would at least personally have no problem jettisoning jemalloc further, especially if there's problems. If disabling jemalloc solves the issue, I say do that.

Odd! I tested a523fba with x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, but maybe I botched something? If it works for you locally I'd trust that.

I thought windows-gnu was in general an awful hurdle to overcome, but if x86_64 already works I didn't think it was i686 specific, but it may be worth double checking if you've got the cycles.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

Ah OK so on the backtrace business I have a backport to reenable full and there's ongoing discussion of how to work with it. In any case working around locally or setting full should be fine for now.

For the latter I'd recommend downloading the literal toolchain used on the bots (downloaded in appveyor.yml) to ensure it's the same, although we can certainly update that whenever we need to as well (we just haven't ever had impetus to do so).

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I've been experimenting with i686-pc-windows-gnu and the toolchains specified in appveyor.yml: If I understand the situation correctly, we want mingw builds which use win32 threads. This causes problems when compiling llvm, since those toolchains don't have support for std::thread. (I also tried newer versions of those toolchains, same result). (This also means that my success with x86_64-pc-windows-gnu is probably invalid).

I'll try to find time to look into this in the next few days.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

Yeah unfortunately this may end up being one of the more difficult parts of the LLVM upgrade (not that the parts leading up to this have been easy ...). @vadimcn is right in that we intentionally have not used the pthread toolchain yet for various reasons. The landscape is very different today though from way-back-when, notably MSVC is a thing that is also tier 1.

My thoughts on this are in order of preference (but not in order of feasibility):

Ideally we stop shipping i686-pc-windows-gnu targets. MinGW just flat out is not supported by LLVM afaik, and yet we keep trying to get it to work. This is unfortunately a pretty invasive change though. While possible I think this is a last resort style option due to the work involved to implement this.

;##D39 Or we switch to pthread toolchain
;##ROLE PM
;##INV F
;##FORM SOL
;##REL ELAB D38

Otherwise ideally I like @vadimcn's idea of compiling the compiler with a pthread toolchain. The hard constraint here is that a user-compiled program should not depend on the pthread dll and should be compatible with the win32 toolchain. Note that I think the dependency on the pthread dll arises from the unwinder, not Rust code nowadays. AFAIK libstd uses nothing fro the mingw runtime other than the unwinder (which is a pretty big piece ...)

I hadn't heard of the compiler @petrochenkov mentioned, but sounds plausible! I'm slightly wary of switching to a semi-random compiler to compile all our builds, but we may not have many other options.

;##D40 We could remove threading support for llvm
;##ROLE PM
;##INV F
;##FORM SOL
;##REL NEW
;##SEN NEU

Finally, we can look again to ripping out threading support from LLVM. We don't want LLVM to spawn threads anyway, and I believe most synchronization primitives at least are implemented in the i686-pc-windows-gnu win32 toolchain. This is obviously the most distasteful approach though.

Mostly I'm up for anything here. My only real hard constraint is that we can't impact users of the i686-pc-windows-gnu toolchain (e.g. the binaries they generate), but other than that I think we can pick whatever works first.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

The meganz/mingw-std-threads @petrochenkov Is the same thing I linked above -- basically just three headers, which provide thread, mutex and condition_variable. However LLVM uses other stuff as well, such as futures, async and packaged_task which are provided neither by mingw nor by these additional headers.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I did a quick check on the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu which was compiled by msys2/mingw, which is the pthread/seh version as far as I can tell: According to dependency walker, rustc has a transitive dependency on winpthread through librustc_llvm -> libstc++6 -> winpthreads. libstd and a program compiled by that toolchain seem to be winpthread free.

Edit: Note that this was without statically linking libstdc++ into llvm.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

Ah so the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu unwinder is very different than the i686-pc-windows-gnu unwinder, so it may be worth double checking i686. If libstd binaries picked up a dependency on winpthreads my guess is it'd be through that (the unwinder)

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Yeah, I don't think we can get around the pthread dependency on i686 easily, if at all. However I'm still happy that  we can probably get away with pthread/seh on x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.

Out of curiosity, do you have download / usage stats for the different windows versions of rust?

I'm pretty confident this toolchain switch will not affect programs compiled by the compiler (the unwinder is implemented in Rust and kernel32.dll, not in the mingw libraries)

Unfortunately we don't have many usage stats :(

>>>JordiPolo, Contributor

>>>vadimcn, Contributor

I've managed to build the compiler with msys2's i686 mingw toolchain, but this required several manual steps.

First of all, since gcc's unwinder depends on pthreads, we'll need to add println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=pthread"); after this line.

stage0 failed to build stage1 because it does not have the line above.  Setting RUSTC_FLAGS=-Clink-arg=-lpthread didn't seem to have any effect, so I fixed this by copying libgcc_eh.a and import libs from a nightly into stage0/lib/rustlib/i686-pc-windows-gnu/lib.

Using the newly built stage1 toolchain I compiled a test program, and found out that it depends on winpthread1.dll :(
Turns out gcc has both static and dynamic version of libpthread, and by default it prefers the dynamic one.   Fixed this by deleting libpthread.dll.a from msys/mingw32/i686-w64-mingw32/lib.

After all that my test program compiled and did not depend on winpthread dll.
Not sure how to fix 2. and 3. in rustbuild though...

If you are rebasing, remember to apply the fix in #40779 to your LLVM (or you'll get a test failure on ARM).

>>>TimNN, Contributor

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I reported the PowerPC failure as https://bugs.llvm.org//show_bug.cgi?id=32485.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I have a tentative (but probably a bit too heavy-handed for inclusion in upstream LLVM) fix for the PowerPC failure at TimNN/llvm@aa34b2c, which simply disables the bad optimisation in more situations.

With that patch PowerPC completes successfully.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So, I also went back to the ARM failures:

To recap: compiler-rt got a few patches which added code specific for Thumb1. With those patches applied our builds were failing in strange ways.

I originally stated that our cross compiler had __ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB=2 defined, so those patches should not apply to us. Revisiting the issue I noticed that, due to us passing -march=armv6 to the compiler, it's actually using __ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB=1.

Thus my new fix is to patch gcc-rs to use -march=armv6t2.

This seems to fix the main problem on ARM and incidentally the jemalloc deadlock as well.

Still remaining are panic-runtime/abort.rs and run-pass/panic-runtime/abort-link-to-unwinding-crates.rs not terminating.

Adjusting dist-arm-linux is ok, although optional. It basically just affects how we compile jemalloc which isn't too too important if it's a little slower than it would be otherwise.

The powerpc patch also seems ok to me, but it'd be great if an LLVM dev could say "yeah seems fine" before we throw it in (it's good that we have an issue to track upstream as well)

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I'm currently debugging the panic-runtime/abort.rs hang: As previously stated it only occurs when RUST_BACKTRACE=1, it gets until _Unwind_Backtrace, where it apparently ends up in some complex endless loop.

As best as I can tell, our trace_fn is called repeated, with the exact same values in the registers and on the stack around $sp.

I have no idea what could be going on. There is a supposedly fixed gcc bug from 2014 which describes somewhat the same symptoms.

If someone wants to take a look, here is a link to the compiled abort test: https://transfer.sh/YJdCY/abort

Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 and foo as an argument and you should have an endlessly running program.

Hint: If gdb shows a broken backtrace (eg. only to entries in gcc_s.so) do stepi until you're out of gcc_s.so.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

@TimNN I wonder if that's related to the super ancient toolchain we're using?

(or is that the other image...)

>>>TimNN, Contributor

@alexcrichton: No, we're actually using a fairly recent toolchain in that image:

On my test raspberry I have gcc 5.2.1.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

Bah that's a bummer.. If worse comes to worse I think we should disable that test. It's a non-tier 1 platform and it's holding up the LLVM upgrade, which probably isn't worth it.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

(disable that test for arm, that is)

>>>nagisa, Contributor

So, the Thumb2 thing is interesting, because sources seem to indicate it is a required extension in ARMv6, but then there’s no point in not having it enabled by default?

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I just patched both of those tests to set RUST_BACKTRACE=0 for the sub command executed, and all other tests passed. So I would just set RUST_BACKTRACE=0 conditionally on the arm target.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

@TimNN that seems like a reasonable workaround to me at least, yeah.

Note that if we take that route we should file an issue to track fixing it, but that's ok.

>>>alexcrichton, Owner

guh didn't mean to close

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So, it appears that the thumb 1 implementation of (at least) __udivsi3 is simply incorrect, it doesn't even pass compiler-rt's unittests when compiled with -march=arm.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

With the -D__ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB=0 proposed by @nagisa in alexcrichton/gcc-rs#149 the compiler-rt unit tests pass as well, so I'll see what happens if I pass that to the compiler-rt build.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I reported the bad Thumb1 builtin as https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32492

>>>TimNN, Contributor

I've switched to a different fix for the ARM builtin failures: manually defining __ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB=0 in the compiler-rt build script, as suggested in alexcrichton/gcc-rs#149.

Note that this does not fix the panic-runtime/abort* failures, so extra path for them is still required.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Since the linux builds seem to be done now (except for emscripten, I'll try to report that bug upstream this week) I've been looking into macOS today:

Except for one debuginfo test, everything passes!

The failing test is cross-crates-span.rs: The same generic function (from another crate) is called with different type parameters. The test sets a breakpoint in that function. The breakpoint in one of the instantiations of the generic function is not hit (I've experimented with different combinations).

I'll continue looking into that, though if anyone has any insights, please let me know.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So, well, I checked, and cross-crates-span.rs fails for me with LLVM 3.9 as well, so I guess that's good news and I'll just assume it will pass on the bots.

The iOS build was successful as well, which means we should be getting pretty close to getting this merged.

This means I will be looking into Windows again next.

As expected MinGW with Win32 threads doesn't work since it doesn't provide std::thread (c++). MinGW with Posix threads required some additional, manual linking of libpthread and libgcc_s (despite #40805) and now causes undefined reference to LLVMRustSetLLVMOptions, rustc_llvm::initialize_available_targets::hdba7e30f03a6524a with MinGW64.

I've repro'd the linker error. This is very strange - these 4 symbols are exported from rustc_llvm-XXXXXXX.dll

>>>vadimcn, Contributor

these 4 symbols are exported from rustc_llvm-XXXXXXX.dll

Actually, it seems that I was wrong abut that.  After rebuilding everything from scratch, I found that rustc_llvm-XXXXXXX.dll exported only a handful of symbols, all of them from emscripten's "Relooper" library (e.g. rl_new_relooper).

Why had this happened?  This page gives the answer:

By default ld exports symbols with the auto-export functionality,
[...]
If, however, -export-all-symbols is not given explicitly on the command line, then the default auto-export behavior will be disabled if either of the following are true:

A DEF file is used.

Any symbol in any object file was marked with the __declspec(dllexport) attribute.

As it happens, Relooper's public API is marked with __declspec(dllexport) and so all other symbols become private.
I found it a bit hard to believe that this is the first time we are coming across this case, but setting RUSTFLAGS=-CLink-arg=-Wl,--export-all-symbols did fix the build.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

@vadimcn: Awesome, thanks for the investigation!

>>>TimNN, Contributor

So how do we best fix this?

With my admittedly limited understanding of the situation, we have multiple choices, I think:

Fix this for rustbuild only:

Use RUSTFLAGS
Update cargo to support adding -Clink-arg=... from the build script of rustc_llvm
Hack something together with #[link_args=...] and features set in the build script of rustc_llvm

Fix this in rustc:

on mingw, always pass --export-all-symbols

To fix it robustly, we should either start passing --export-all-symbols when linking Rust dylibs, or provide an explicit list of exports as @retep998 suggests.

Dropping the jemalloc bits should be fine, I'm dubious that optimization ever kicked in anyway.

I'd also idly muse that there's no real reason to use the literal release_40 branch. We could reduce the stack of patches by a lot I think by just using LLVM tip (as of like right now). I think that'd cause problems with emscripten though, right? (different merge bases) It seems like we should also stick with the current merge base as you've already done all the testing. You should mostly disregard this paragraph.

The compiler-rt submodule looks a little suspicious though, so I just wanted to confirm. I think the following PRs are missing from the rust-2017-04-13, was that intentional? (I don't recall upstreaming many of these...)

rust-lang/compiler-rt#24 - UB with INT_MIN in an intrinsic

rust-lang/compiler-rt#26 - was this fixed upstream in LLVM, right?

rust-lang/compiler-rt#27 - infinite recursion on FreeBSD in an intrinsic

rust-lang/compiler-rt#28 - fixing rust-lang/compiler-rt#27 I think?

rust-lang/compiler-rt#31 - more mystery on sparc?

One open question remains: Given that the next beta is cut in 11 days, should we postpone merging this until after the beta (to give more time to find and fix any regressions)?

Yeah if you're ok with it I'd prefer to stay conservative here and wait until after beta is branched (should happen late next week) before merging this. This looks like it's got a lot of potential for accidental regressions!

Although it may be good to at some point categorize the number of bugs this (the upgrade to LLVM 4.0) fixes. If it fixes enough bugs we may wish to land it for beta and deal with the backports.

>>>TimNN, Contributor

Could you expand the commit message for rust-lang/llvm@4275d89?

Of course. I'll add a link to @vadimcn's comment to the comment added in that commit.

Could you remove the PR merge commits? (should be ok to just cherry-pick the actual commits)

That's what I had originally when @arielb1 requested on IRC I use the merge commits so that the original PR number was linked from the cherry picks. Although I can easily go back to the non merge commit version.

Yay, looks like all the builds timed out again, so things seem to be good to go. (I didn't verify all the logs this time).

@TimNN looks great to me!

I hope to branch beta later today, so want to pull out the fast-fail? I'll r+ this after the beta is branched.

I'd also like to reiterate that you're at least my own personal "Rust Hero of the last N Months" where N is two and counting. If we delay this for 3 more days then it'll be a 2+ month PR!

@alexcrichton: I removed the always fail commit.

Thanks a lot! All the positive encouragement and feedback has helped a lot in keeping me motivated to work on the upgrade :).

Wow! Thanks a lot @TimNN! That is some effort!

I've just noticed that README mentions clang 3.x. Shouldn't this be updated?

>>>rkruppe, Contributor

@Kixunil That part of the readme is about the C and C++ compiler used for compiling C and C++ dependencies during the build, not about the LLVM version.

>>>Kixunil, Other

@rkruppe I guess I'm too hungry and tired. Thank you for pointing that out! :)
