There's no reason why Rails shouldn't promote a multithreaded mindset by now, it seems like the next logical step after dropping Ruby 1.8. Also, yes it's true we use Passenger and Unicorn nowadays, and they're both great and I don't expect them to go away any time soon.

josevalim,"@tenderlove Agreed. I just wish we start doing our due diligence now, possibly backporting the latest thread safety fixes to 3-2-stable so we can try it out now. Based on my previous experience with config.threadsafe!, there were bugs related to autoload even in production mode where we eager load most of the stuff. Development mode uses another strategy for code loading, which may have even more thread-related bugs (I have no idea what will happen if two threads try to autoload the same constant at the same time via AS::Dependencies).

josevalim,"@tarcieri Seems reasonable. The thing is that the resolver currently uses a nested hash structure which I believe would be expensive expensive with ConcurrentHashMap.
