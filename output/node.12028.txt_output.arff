sam-github,"On stripping of NODEOPT env var during spawn: I think it takes away from the usefullness of NODEOPT (specifically, it means we can't use NODEOPT= -r node-report  npm install ... to debug install scripts), intrudes confusingly into the child_process API, and goes against the basic philosophy of environment, which is that environment is inherited by children.",FALSE,TRUE,55,25,69,1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,0,26,1

jasnell,"For instance, imagine a child process that uses fs.readFileSync() internally to read a file and return it's contents to the parent. The parent is written to scan stdout / stderr to determine whatever status it needs to know. The child process is launched specifically assuming that flags like --trace-sync-io are not passed (because it is not passed in the args).

I can switch it around to opt-in for node, I think there is a way I can do that, but there are 417 V8 options as of this moment on master, and they all look like the kinds of things someone might want to set via env to tune performance or diagnose mis-performance, and there don't appear to be anything we'd want to blacklist.",FALSE,TRUE,74,34,104,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,0,35,4
jasnell,"@sam-github ... no, if NODEOPT is explicitly passed in the call to fork like in your example, it would be used.
