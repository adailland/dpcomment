<title>Undervaluing Royal Mail shares cost taxpayers £750m in one day</title>
<sentencetext> Undervaluing Royal Mail shares cost taxpayers £750m in one day 
 The government &apos;s desperation to sell Royal Mail cost taxpayers £750m in a single day , the National Audit Office has said in a scathing report into the privatisation of the 500-year-old national institution .  
 The public spending watchdog says the business secretary Vince Cable ploughed ahead with plans to float Royal Mail at a maximum price of 330p-a-share despite repeated warnings from City experts that the government had vastly undervalued the company .  
 The audit office said in a report today that Cable chose not to heed the warnings and increase the flotation price from the 260-330p range because of fears it could put off institutional investors and jeopardise the flotation as postal workers were preparing for nationwide strike action .  
 The watchdog said the business department &apos;s keen desire to achieve a successful sale of Royal Mail within this parliament &quot;resulted in the shares being priced at a level substantially below that at which they started trading &quot; .  
 Royal Mail &apos;s shares spiked 38 % on their debut on the stock market on 11 October - the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987 - as investors tried to buy up more than 23 times the number of shares available .  
 The audit office said the government could have made an additional £750m for taxpayers if it had priced the sale at the first day closing price of 455p rather than the maximum 330p starting price .  
 Achieving an additional £750m from the sale could have covered the annual salaries of an additional 34,000 NHS nurses .  
 The early jump in the share price , dismissed by Cable as &quot;froth and speculation &quot; was followed by a continued rise to a peak of 618p in January .  
 The shares closed at 563p yesterday , still 70 % higher than the float price .  
 Amyas Morse , head of the audit office , said : &quot; The department was very keen to achieve its objective of selling Royal Mail , and was successful in getting the company listed on the FTSE 100 .  
 Its approach , however , was marked by deep caution , the price of which was borne by the taxpayer .  
 &quot; Cable said : &quot; Achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale .  
 The report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high .  
 And a failed sale would have been the worst outcome for taxpayers and jeopardised the operation of Royal Mail .  
 &quot; The audit office said the government &apos;s pricing decision was largely influenced by Cable &apos;s desire for &quot;long-term , blue chip &quot; institutional investors to buy and hold large chunks of Royal Mail shares .  
 Despite overwhelming public demand for the shares ( the public ordered enough to own the whole of the postal service but were cut down to just £750 per person ) , Cable allowed 16 long-term investors , mostly pension funds , priority access to the shares .  
 The audit office said this was part of the government &apos;s &quot;expectation that they would form part of a stable long-term and supportive shareholder base &quot; .  
 At the time , Cable said : &quot; We wanted to make sure that the company started its new life with a core of high quality investors who would be there in good times and bad , interested in Royal Mail and the universal service it provides for consumers over the long term .  
 &quot; However , the audit office said six of the 16 &quot;priority investors &quot; selected by Cable had sold all of their allocation within weeks of the float , at a substantial profit .  
 The watchdog said that by the end of January 2014 just 12 % of the company &apos;s shares were held by the &quot;priority investors &quot; .  
 A large proportion of their shares were gobbled up by hedge funds , which Cable has repeatedly attacked for being short term investors , describing them as &quot; spivs and gamblers &quot; .  
 Within a fortnight of the float , a London hedge fund whose boss was memorably described as a &quot;locust &quot; by German politicians , bought up so many shares that it became Royal Mail &apos;s second-biggest investor after the government , which retained a 30 % stake .  
 The Children &apos;s Investment Fund , which is run by billionaire Chris Hohn , bought up 5.8 % of the shares .  
 It has since cut its stake down below 5 % .  
 The audit office also criticised the government for relying too heavily on its advisers , predominately the investment bank Lazard .  
 The watchdog said the government gave Lazard an incentive &quot; solely to complete a transaction &quot; – not to achieve the maximum value for taxpayers .  
 &quot; The taxpayer interest was not clearly prioritised within the structure of the independent adviser &apos;s role , &quot; the audit office said in its report .  
 And it revealed that the government asked its advisers if it should increase the offer price in the days before the float .  
 The department &apos;s banking advisers said the top of the price range could be increased by 20p to 350p - which would have made an extra £120m for taxpayers .  
 However , Lazards and the banks advised against increasing the price for fear it could have put off investors .  
 This was despite some of the banking syndicate &apos;s analysts valuing the shares as high as 510p , with no one reckoning they were worth less than 300p .  
 Lazards advised selling the shares at between 212-262p .  
 Lazard was paid £1.5m for its advice .  
 The government spent a total of £12.7m on fees to bankers , including UBS , Goldman Sachs , Barclays and Merrill Lynch , accountants , lawyers and PR advisers .  
 Margaret Hodge , chair of the public accounts committee , said the department for business made a &quot; critical error by incentivising its private advisers to sell the shares on time at the expense of price &quot; .  
 She said the 70 % rise in Royal Mail &apos;s share price since flotation shows that the department &quot;had no clue what it was doing&quot; .  
 Hodge said she was looking forward to &quot;discussing this second class performance &quot; when the department gives evidence to the committee in May .  
 Chuka Umunna , the shadow business secretary , said the audit office &apos;s report was a &quot;damning verdict on the Tory-led government &apos;s botched Royal Mail fire sale , leaving the taxpayer disgracefully short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds &quot; .  
 Billy Hayes , general secretary of the Communication Workers Union that represents postmen and women , said the report &quot;finds the government guilty &quot;of overseeing a &quot;get rich quick &quot; scheme which offered no value to taxpayers .  
 Unite national officer Brian Scott said : &quot; This report is startling proof that the government sold off the country &apos;s family silver on the cheap . &quot;

 Of course not .  
 Why not ?

 What a society .  
 And the bankers ... Well , say no more .  
 Totally immune from prosecution as we have seen from the banking crisis .

<sentencetext>  richardbj 01 April 2014 8:37am : wasting public (yours and mine ) money And from the headline : Undervaluing Royal Mail shares costs taxpayer £750m This is n&apos;t the correct way to look at things .  
 The scandal is n&apos;t that taxpayers are losing out , in some technical accounting error .  
 It &apos;s that privatisation has succeeded in transferring wealth from the less well-off to the better-off .  
 That &apos;s the whole purpose of privatisation , and it worked well in this case , with £750 million in effect being transferred upwards .

<sentencetext>  No one thinks that the tories will ever get back into government again , and Cameron knows that he has led the tory party into a political graveyard .  
 But that really does n&apos;t matter , does it ?  
 The money is flowing the right way - upwards - and no future government seems likely to change that .  
 I would say - on their terms - they have done a good job .  
 The rich are considerably richer and the poor are suitably punished and crushed .  
 I am not that confident that they will not get in again , given the lack of any coherent strategy from the opposition .

<sentencetext>  This is all part of a process , which started back in Tudor times , called &apos;Enclosure &apos; .  
 In those days it was land .  
 And the rich and powerful stole it off the poor and weak , without any compensation .  
 All the poor were left with were a few bits of scrubby common land that was good for nothing .  
 Now the rich and powerful ca n&apos;t steal in quite the same way , but steal they still do .  
 And rather than land , which has all gone , it is now commonly-owned assets/enterprises/industry .  
 The railways , telecommunications , energy , water , Royal Mail , they have all been stolen from you .  
 Oh ... sure ... ordinary people could buy a minuscule few shares .  
 But the rich and powerful knew that the public are n&apos;t really into buying and selling shares .  
 They knew that the public would sell their tiny holdings for a quick buck a little while down the line , leaving the R&amp;P holding the property .  
 They could bide their time to make a killing .  
 And that &apos;s what they &apos;ve done/are doing .  
 Enclosure , in whatever form , has had a profound effect on British society .  
 And not a good one .

<sentencetext>  Well this would make sense if ( a ) governments knew how to run businesses - they do n&apos;t and never will , as this story ironically underlines , and ( b ) that &apos;nationalised &apos; companies actually belonged to - in any real sense - the people .  
 The nationalized companies were run effectively on behalf of the people who worked for them , not the public - much as the NHS is run today .  
 Since their managements were notoriously inefficient &apos;the people &apos; were actually paying through the nose for their upkeep - a double whammy since they covered inefficiencies twice : through above market pricing and through higher taxes .  
 If you translate a public monopoly into a private one you get rid of the latter but not of course the former .  
 The principle of privatization is 100 % sound ; the execution of the concept has I agree been flawed but it is entirely disingenuous to then use this as an argument for &apos;nationalisation &apos; .

 The words &apos;gentleman &apos;s agreement &apos; and The City are no longer appropriate , trust in The City and our Banking &amp; Financial Services institutions is at an all time low .  
 All they seem fit for is managing tax have n goodies , money laundering , fraudulent behaviour and oligarchs ill gotten gains .  
 Yet again , proper reform is desperately needed if we are to retain this important industry .  
 …..not letting the government off the hook here by the way .  
 Westminster and The City are way too close too each other with too many living in each others pockets . the Coalition has screwed up badly here , Vince Cable has screwed up badly and we , the electorate have been screwed .  
 Again .

<sentencetext>  Interesting , though not surprising with this lot of charlatans , of course .  
 Let &apos;s hear you Miliband - so much to get your teeth in to here .  
 Get your finger out .  
 In a civilised society , many of the people involved in this cack-handed , bargain-bucket sale would be facing long jail terms for screwing us for the benefit of their friends .  
 I &apos;d welcome a violent revolution that takes these people out .

<sentencetext>  Goldman Sachs told the Government that 330p was a fair price to sell RM off at , and ONE WEEK LATER told its clients that the long term expected price was 610p .  
 Where are the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority in all this ?  
 If this is n&apos;t wholesale fraud , I do n&apos;t know what is .

<sentencetext>  And so this awful Government just ignores the criticism and carries on regardless This is incompetence and Cable should resign , the press and the BBC just let it go - Why ?  
 Oh well they can cut a few more benefits and make the disabled pay for it !  
 The important thing is the City boys are well pleased
