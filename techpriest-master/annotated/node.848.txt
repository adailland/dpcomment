Internal modules can be used to share private code between public modules without risk to expose private APIs to the user.

Not a big fan of this feature.
If someone uses things that aren't documented then there is a known risk that that code won't work in future versions.
This is true for a lot more things than modules, i.e. functions on prototypes that aren't part of the API but used internally. Usually those are marked as _functionName.


As an example inside readline-vim I depend on readline._ttyWrite but only consider myself lucky that the code didn't break due to the function name changing. However I knew that risk when I wrote that code.


Same is true for any modules only to be used internally. If you wanna use them, fine but just know the risk. But if you start trying to encapsulate those you'd then also have to encapsulate the _private functions.


From my experience in other OO environments I've come to the conclusion that encapsulation is overrated. Just let the users make the right decisions. Marking things private explicitly or implicitly (by not documenting them) should suffice.

I'm unsure about this change. Yes, developers using private modules causes hesitancy when putting breaking changes into the source and not bumping semver-major, but we have to draw the line somewhere - and I think that should be whether or not it is documented. The programmer should know what they are doing, and if they know what they are doing and want to require a private module, we shouldn't restrict them from doing that.

While you are right (as I have already said), what you say is unrealistic and unreasonable.


Let's say _ and not documenting is enough. So let's remove util._extend. I bet half of npm would break. It can be done in one line, there numerous libraries on npm, and people still use it.


It's so easy to discover something not documented using REPL. root instead of global? cool I'll use that!. process.EventEmitter? cool, one require less. And so one. People who do that are asking for trouble, no doubt. But what about people depending on their modules? They do nothing wrong.

encourages modularity in lib- we can have small files, deep structure, etc. (/lib/internal/http/parser.js)

I'd agree that it's io.js / node that pay for other developers risks. Especially with how graph like dependencies are in node it's easy for one person's risk to affect hundreds without them realizing. In other languages it's a lot harder to shoot yourself in the foot (.NET for example requires you write reflection code and a level of execution permission that people don't assume).


This will always be a balance but if one of io.js goals is agility then it seems to fit.

In many languages it's possible to use modules internally but not expose them to the outside. This isn't only a problem in core, it would also be a nice ability in userland to signal that a specific file from a module should not be included directly. Popular userland libraries share the issue.


Something like a:




module[Symbol.for("internal")] = true;




Which would mean this file should not be included from the outside - only from within the module or core. It's not a well thought out idea but I hope it gets the point across.


I also think that @trevnorris's comments about ES6 modules are really important - any change here can have an impact on ES6 modules that don't do this sort of thing.

On the server side it is only a little bit higher memory usage, but for browserify it makes a big difference in filesize.

I'm not 100% sure if you should be using os.sep here... I guess it depends on whether gyp converts the slashes to backslashes on Windows.

@vkurchatkin Can you add a test that verifies that --expose_internals works?  Should be trivial:

@bnoordhuis updated, PTAL


>>>bnoordhuis, Owner


LGTM and sorry for the delay.  I'd suggest landing it after the 1.6.0 release.


>>>vkurchatkin, Member


@bnoordhuis thank you. I'm going to land this in a couple of days

This commit causes the entire windows test suite to fail due to some config loading issue: https://jenkins-iojs.nodesource.com/view/iojs/job/iojs+any-pr+multi/381/nodes=iojs-win2008r2/console




>>>Fishrock123, Owner


I don't really understand how it could cause that, but the parent commit works fine, and this ones throws like crazy.


>>>bnoordhuis, Owner


I'll look into it.  I think I know what's causing it and I guess I'm partially to blame for lgtm'ing without pointing out the CI failures.
